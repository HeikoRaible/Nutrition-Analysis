# Nutrition Analysis

This repository is for the collection and analysis of my personal weight, macronutrients and calories.

## Data Collection

Software used to collect data were OpenScale (weight) and Macros (macronutrients and calories). Collection was only consistent and reliable in the timeperiod of 08/2021 - 03/2022.

## Analysis

The main takeaway is the confirmation of the calories in vs. calories out guideline, meaning if you use more calories than you ingest, you will lose weight (weight positively correlates with calories). Macronutrients don't vary much in the time period of reliable data, which was during a diet, so no conclusions can be drawn.
